        <p><a href="http://www.loscampesinos.com" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">Los Campesinos!</a> is a seven-member band formed in Cardiff in early 2006.
          Their first and second albums both came out in 2008! That's prolific. Oddly enough (and this shows how flawed memory can be!)
          I remember listening to them in high school. I graduated in 2006! I think part of it is that they've been such a big part of my life since their first album came out
          that I can barely remember what not knowing them was like. On the other hand, I spent a lot of time scouring the web for music back then, and it's possible I first
          heard them when they were almost completely unknown. It doesn't really matter because they are the best! One of the few bands I have followed for over 10 years.<p>

          I almost forgot! Their discography, ranked (by me!):
